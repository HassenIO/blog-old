Hello world!

In [part 1](../create-your-first-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws-part-1/), we created a basic web app and pushed a Docker image containing the app to Docker Hub.

## 📚 Requirements for part 2

Like with part 1, here is what we need to setup before starting part 2:

- To work with Kubernetes, you must have **`kubectl` installed locally**. This is the CLI client to create, manage and interact with the cluster. [Install it locally](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).
- **An AWS account**. Create a free account on [https://aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com).
- The **`aws` CLI installed locally**. Follow instructions in the [official AWS CLI installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) page for your operating system.
- **`kops` CLI installed locally**. Install it by following [this link](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/install.md).
